                    Also, moving the fundamental navigation options such as "Settings" to the top right corner of the page allows the focus for the side bar navigation to be solely on app relevance.

                <p>One of the main challenges imposed on this project was the time frame and role responsibilities. Agile development was necessary for quick pushes and multiple iterations for production. As a team, we had to repeatedly learn how to not get caught up with the little details and to release quickly to make deadlines. Communication was also another major factor since the Project Managers, whose English was a second language. Also, there was an unclear role assignment on who was the primary Designers for the project.
